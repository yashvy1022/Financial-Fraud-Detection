    ## Introduction

    Digital payments of various forms are rapidly increasing across the world. Payments 
    companies are experiencing rapid growth in their transactions volume. For example, 
    PayPal processed ~$578 billion in total payments in 2018. Along with this transformation, 
    there is also a rapid increase in financial fraud that happens in these payment systems.

    Preventing online financial fraud is a vital part of the work done by cybersecurity and 
    cyber-crime teams. Most banks and financial institutions have dedicated teams of dozens 
    of analysts building automated systems to analyze transactions taking place through their 
    products and flag potentially fraudulent ones. Therefore, it is essential to explore the 
    approach to solving the problem of detecting fraudulent entries/transactions in large 
    amounts of data in order to be better prepared to solve cyber-crime cases.
